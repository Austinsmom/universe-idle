# universe-idle
Incremental game that makes you travel from one "edge" of the universe to the other.

## Concept
Something went terribly wrong.
Your ship is the size of a quark.
Yes, apparently it's possible.
You have to go home as quick as possible.
To do that, you have to travel throughout the entire universe.
You'd better get some speed...
## Compilation
This project uses cmake to build.
### On linux
Once cloned:
1. Make 'compile.sh' executable
2. run $./compile gui
### On other plateforms
Not the faintest idea...
