# universe-idle
Incremental game that makes you travel from one "edge" of the universe to the other.

## Concept
Something went terribly wrong.<br />
Your ship is now the size of a quark.<br />
Yes, apparently it's possible.<br />
You have to go home as fast as possible.<br />
Your home is on other side of the universe.<br />
Did I tell you your ship is the size of a quark?<br />
You'd better get some **heavy** speed...<br />
## Build
This project uses cmake to build.
### On linux
Once cloned:
1. Make 'compile.sh' executable
2. run $./compile gui

It works for me. It might as well work for you...
### On other plateforms
Not the faintest idea...
