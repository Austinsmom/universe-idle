- [X] compute remaining time until destination


* Messages
** TODO Create message lib
** TODO Implement output messages with priority (3 levels?)
* Improvment
** TODO Better to_string() functions [0/3]
Improve readability of to_string() functions associated with BigNum
based classes
- [ ] BigNum
- [ ] Speed
- [ ] Distance
- [ ] Acceleration
- [ ] Time

** Refactorize
*** TODO Split into dedicated modules [1/2]
- [X] physics
- [ ] computaiton

* Design
** Unique upgrades
- Access to terminal (15e)
- Access to window (20e)?
- First continuous source of energy (quantum magnetism)
- Throttle Lvl 1
- Solar panels
- Generate energy through speed (dynamo)
- Radad (determite position and remaining time)

** Incremental upgrades
- First source of energy
- Lvl 1 energy cells for booster
** Steps
-> Terminal

-> First booster (Unique upgrade)
-> Buy energy cells
